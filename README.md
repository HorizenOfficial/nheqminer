# Nheqminer

Equihash/zcash/zec miner (can be used for pool mining)

**NOTE: Common mistake is to clone this repo without recursive, you need to use --recursive**

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/nheqminer
```

**Your build with XENON/XENONCAT will fail otherwise**

# Features

Major things:
- Implemented all fast implementations (tromp and xenoncat with AVX1/AVX2) 
- Better support for other platforms

Platforms:
- Linux (tromp, xenoncat support)
- Mac OS X (tromp and xenoncat support)
- Windows (tromp, xenoncat but need tweaking)

# Usage

### flypool
`nheqminer -l eu1-zcash.flypool.org:3333 -u ZcashTransparentAddress`

Example:
`nheqminer -l eu1-zcash.flypool.org:3333 -u t1JBZzdaUUSJDs8q7SUxcCSzakThqtNRtNv`

### suprnova
nheqminer -l zec.suprnova.cc:2142 -u suprnovaaccount.1 -p x -t threadCount 

Example:
`nheqminer -l zec.suprnova.cc:2142 -u suprnova.1 -p x`

### zmine
`nheqminer  -l zmine.io:1337 -u ZcashTransparentAddress`

Example:
`nheqminer  -l zmine.io:1337 -u t1JBZzdaUUSJDs8q7SUxcCSzakThqtNRtNv`

## Production usage

I would suggest putting nheqminer inside while true loop in order to have basic watchdog. i.e.
`while true; do nheqminer -l zec.suprnova.cc:2142 -u suprnova.1 -p x; echo "sleep & restart"; sleep 30; done`

# Building

Add -DXENON to cmake to build with AVX/AVX2 support. 

## Options to build Fastest miner

If you are building for Linux and for your processor on local machine (with AVX1/AVX2 automatically detected) , you can say something like:

`cmake -DXENON=1 ..`

This will build -march=native by default. 

If you need to transfer binaries to other machines and automatically detect AVX1/AVX2 or not, you can say something like:

`cmake -DXENON=1 -DMARCH="-m64" ..`

If you don't want to compile with AVX/AVX2 support, just build without any options:

`cmake  ..`

Note AVX/AVX2 binaries should automatically downgrade to tromp if nothing else found.

Full example:
```
sudo apt-get install cmake build-essential libboost-all-dev
git clone --recursive https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/nheqminer.git
cd nheqminer/nheqminer
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DXENON=1 ..
make
```

## Linux cmake **recommended** (Tested on Ubuntu Desktop 14.04 and 16.04 and Ubuntu server 14.04):
You should have **CMake** installed (2.8 minimal version), boost (install from the repositories or download boost manually build and install it manually), download the sources manually or via git. 
Under Ubuntu open a terminal and run the following commands:
  - `sudo apt-get install cmake build-essential libboost-all-dev`
  - `git clone --recursive https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/nheqminer.git`
  - `cd nheqminer/nheqminer`
  - `mkdir build`
  - `cd build`
  - `cmake -DXENON=1 ..`
  - `make`

Note: for the fastest miner, it is recommended to use `cmake -DXENON=1 ..`

## Windows cmake **recommended** (Tested on Fedora 23):
You should have **CMake** installed (2.8 minimal version), boost (install from the repositories or download boost manually build and install it manually), download the sources manually or via git.

## Mac OS X  (Tromp and Xenoncat):
You need to have git, cmake, make and Mac OS X Developer stuff (compiler, etc).
Under Mac open a terminal and run the following commands:
  - `git clone --recursive https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/nheqminer.git`
  - `cd nheqminer/nheqminer`
  - `mkdir build`
  - `cd build`

# Run instructions:

If run without parameters, miner will start mining with 75% of available virtual cores on flypool with developers account using best engine. Feel free to donate that way. Use parameter -h to learn about available parameters:

```
Parameters:
        -h              Print this help and quit
        -l [location]   Stratum server:port
        -u [username]   Username (pool worker)
        -x [enginenum]  Engine (-1=auto,0=tromp,1=AVX1,2=AVX2)
        -p [password]   Password (default: x)
        -t [num_thrds]  Number of threads (default: number of sys cores)
        -d [level]      Debug print level (0 = print all, 5 = fatal only, default: 2)
        -b [hashes]     Run in benchmark mode (default: 100 hashes)
        -a [port]       Local API port (default: 0 = do not bind)
```

Example to run benchmark:

        nheqminer_x64_AVX.exe -b
        
Example to run with full logging (including network dump):

        nheqminer_x64_AVX.exe -d 0
        
Example to mine with your own ZEC address and worker1 on USA server:

        nheqminer_x64_AVX.exe -l eu1-zcash.flypool.org:3333 -u YOUR_ZCASH_ADDRESS_HERE.worker1

Example to mine with your own ZEC address and worker1 on EU server, using 6 threads:

        nheqminer_x64_AVX.exe -l eu1-zcash.flypool.org:3333 -u YOUR_ZCASH_ADDRESS_HERE.worker1 -t 6

<i>Note: if you have a 4-core CPU with hyper threading enabled (total 8 threads) it is best to run with only 6 threads (experimental benchmarks shows that best results are achieved with 75% threads utilized)</i>
